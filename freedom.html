        <h1 style="color: orange;">Warriors of Indian Independence</h1>
        <p>The struggle for India’s independence was marked by the courage, sacrifice, and determination of countless men and women who fought relentlessly to free the nation from colonial rule. These warriors of Indian independence came from diverse backgrounds — freedom fighters, revolutionaries, reformers, leaders, and ordinary citizens — united by a common dream: a free and sovereign India. This tribute honors the brave hearts who laid down their lives, endured imprisonment, and made immeasurable sacrifices so that future generations could live in freedom. Their stories continue to inspire and remind us of the power of resilience and the value of liberty.</p>
